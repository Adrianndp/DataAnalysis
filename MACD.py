"""
The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is another trend-following momentum indicator
that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.
The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA)
from the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line.
