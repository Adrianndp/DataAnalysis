The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis
that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions
in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator
(a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100
